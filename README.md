Inspired by the current trend of Craft Beer, Braubar aims to make microbrewed beer accessible to everyone. The basic idea of Braubar is to partially automate the process of brewing - with affordable and widely available hardware. Aiming for easy adjustability, Braubar relies on open-source and economically efficient technology to recreate - or even enhance - the current microbrewing process.
